# Collaborative LLMs Agents

This project is a demonstration of how multiple LLMs (Language Model-based Learning) agents can collaborate to reflect on each other's output. LLMs are powerful AI models that can generate human-like text based on the input they receive.

## Overview

In this project, we have implemented a system where multiple LLMs agents work together to improve the quality and accuracy of their generated text. Each agent takes turns generating text based on a given prompt, and then the other agents review and provide feedback on the generated output.

## How it Works

1. The first agent receives a prompt and generates a piece of text.
2. The generated text is then passed on to the next agent in the collaboration.
3. The next agent reviews the generated text and provides feedback.
4. The feedback is used to refine the generated text and improve its quality.
5. The process continues with each agent in the collaboration, iteratively refining the generated text.

## Benefits

- Collaboration among multiple LLMs agents allows for a more diverse range of perspectives and insights.
- The feedback loop helps in identifying and correcting errors or biases in the generated text.
- The collaborative approach leads to continuous improvement and refinement of the generated output.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main script to start the collaboration among the LLMs agents.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of multiple LLMs agents and their collaborative approach, we can achieve higher quality and more accurate text generation. This project serves as a demonstration of the potential of collaborative AI systems.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different prompts and agents to see the impact of collaboration on the generated text.
